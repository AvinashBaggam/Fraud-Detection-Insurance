# About project
1)	The classification target attribute is the fraud_reported column: Y (Yes) / N (No)
2)	Analyse the original columns from data sets, identify and remove all kind of outliers and data issues that would endanger the accurate modelling. Show why those transformations were needed and prepare a wrapper for future similar data
3)	Divide the data properly into training, testing and prediction data sets
4)	Create the classification model, prove its efficiency on the testing model and apply it for prediction data set showing also the basis ruleset for the model
5)	Create an application including the previous sets and imagine the application should work on any future data with the same structure (columns and types) as the one in the csv file.
# Objective
The objective is to construct a model to predict which transactions could be fraudulent with high accuracy. A comparative study has been conducted to decide which classifier is best for this project to train the behavior features of normal and abnormal transactions.
# Use Case
I will be creating a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is 
fraudulent or not. The answere between YES/NO, is a Binary Classification task. This report deals with classification algorithm  to detect fraud transaction in Python.
